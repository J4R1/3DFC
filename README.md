# About The Project 
<!-- Screenshot here  -->
<!-- Description here -->
3DFC is an app to transform your surrounding area into a natural history museum, or to add a dash of technology to an already existing one.

It uses AR-technology to display life size animals right next to you, with a small information table above them.

It also has the ability to recognize your current location, so that multiple museums can have differing models.
## Built with

  * Kotlin
  * Android Studio
  * Accessibility in mind: the colors we have used for the text fields are all vision-impaired friendly and all the buttons have alt-texts for screen readers. There is even a button to read the current animals info text out loud.
# Installation & Requirements

## Requirements
  * Minimum SDK version 26 (Android 8 Oreo)
  * Internet access  
    * At this point the animal info only works in Metropolia's networks
  * ARCore compatible phone 
  * Access to location services and camera

## Installation
  1. Download the project
  2. Run through Android Studio  
  
  Or  
 
  1. Download the APK
  2. Sideload into your Android phone
  3. Run

# Usage
<!-- Couple screenshots here  -->
We envisioned 3D Fauna Center to either be a replacement for a live museum experience, used in for example remote areas with little access to such sites or as a easy to implement and modify addition to traditional museums. 

That will explain itself briefly on startup, but here are the main points.

  1. Scan the area around you until a white dot matrix appears.
  2. Choose and animal from the bottom of the screen, it can be rotated using the two buttons at the bottom of the screen.
  3. To hear the info text read out loud, press the image of the speaker, above the right rotation button.
  4. (The button above that is the voice command button, which currently forces an ARCore reset.)
  5. The button on the top left shows a timestamped list of the places you have visited.
