# About The Project 
<!-- Screenshot here  -->
<!-- Description here -->
3DFC is an app that transforms your surrounding area into a natural history museum, or add a dash of technology to an already existing one.

It uses AR-technology to display life size animals right next to you, with a small information table above them.

It also has the ability to recognize your current location, so that multiple museums can have differing models.
## Built with

  * Kotlin
  * Android Studio

# Installation & Requirements

  * Minimun SDK version 26 (Android 8 Oreo)
  * Internet access  
    ** At this point the animal info only works in Metropolia's networks
  * ARCore compatible phone 
  * Access to location services and camera
